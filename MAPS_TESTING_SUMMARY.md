# Google Maps Implementation Testing Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Google Maps Implementation for Kenya
- **Created new `MapScreenKenya`**: A clean, Kenya-focused map implementation
  - Default location: Nairobi, Kenya (-1.2921, 36.8219)
  - Proper location permission handling
  - Enhanced error handling with retry mechanisms
  - Kenya landmark integration (Nairobi CBD, JKIA, Westlands, Karen)

### 2. Updated Location Services for Kenya Focus
- **Updated LocationService**: Now defaults to Nairobi coordinates instead of San Francisco
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better fallback mechanisms for location failures
- **Kenya-specific route simulation**: Simulated routes now follow Kenya locations

### 3. Enhanced MapProvider Functionality
- Added `addMarker()` method for placing landmarks
- Added `startLocationTracking()` method
- Improved location permission checking and handling

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Updated `HomeScreen` to use new `MapScreenKenya`
- Updated `MapNavigationButton` widget to navigate to Kenya map
- Replaced all map navigation references to use the new implementation

## Key Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/lib/screens/map_screen_kenya.dart` - New Kenya-focused map implementation

### Updated Files:
- `/lib/services/location_service.dart` - Kenya coordinates and improved error handling
- `/lib/providers/map_provider.dart` - Added marker management and location tracking
- `/lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Updated imports and navigation
- `/lib/widgets/map_navigation_button.dart` - Updated to use Kenya map

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Build the APK
```bash
cd /home/codename/CascadeProjects/bus-passenger-connect/bus_passenger_connect
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

### 2. Install on Android Device
The APK will be located at:
```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

Install using:
```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

### 3. Test Map Functionality
1. **Basic Map Loading**: Open the app and navigate to the map screen
2. **Kenya Focus**: Verify the map centers on Nairobi, Kenya
3. **Location Permissions**: Test location permission requests
4. **Landmarks**: Check that Kenya landmarks are visible
5. **Route Visualization**: Test route tracking with sample Kenya routes
6. **Error Handling**: Test with location services disabled

### 4. What to Verify

#### Map Loading Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Map should load actual tiles instead of blank/gray area
- ✅ Default location should be Nairobi, Kenya (not San Francisco)
- ✅ Location permissions should be properly requested
- ✅ Error messages should be informative and actionable

#### Kenya-Specific Features:
- ✅ Kenya landmarks should be visible (Nairobi CBD, JKIA, Westlands, Karen)
- ✅ Routes should follow Kenya road patterns
- ✅ Location bounds checking keeps focus within Kenya

#### Real-time Location:
- ✅ Location tracking should work when permissions granted
- ✅ Should fallback gracefully to Nairobi when location unavailable
- ✅ Camera should move to user location if within Kenya bounds

## Technical Details

### Google Maps API Configuration
- API key is properly configured in Android and iOS
- Location permissions are set in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist
- Map initialization follows proper sequence to avoid timing issues

### Kenya Coordinates
- **Nairobi CBD**: -1.2921, 36.8219
- **JKIA Airport**: -1.3192, 36.9278  
- **Westlands**: -1.2641, 36.8028
- **Karen**: -1.3278, 36.7437

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Location permission denials
- Map initialization failures
- GPS unavailability

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Map shows blank/gray area
**Solution**: Implemented proper map initialization sequence with delays and error handling

### Issue: Wrong default location
**Solution**: Changed all default coordinates from San Francisco to Nairobi, Kenya

### Issue: Location permission handling
**Solution**: Added comprehensive permission checking with user-friendly error messages

### Issue: Route visualization problems
**Solution**: Updated sample routes to use Kenya-specific coordinates

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Build and install the APK** on a physical Android device
2. **Test with different network conditions** (WiFi, mobile data, offline)
3. **Test location permissions** (granted, denied, permanently denied)
4. **Verify route tracking** works with Kenya-specific routes
5. **Test error recovery** mechanisms

The Google Maps implementation should now work properly on mobile devices with proper Kenya focus and robust error handling.
