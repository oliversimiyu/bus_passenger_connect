- [ ] **Zoom and pan controls work**
- [ ] **Bus route markers are visible** (green = start, red = end)

### 🚌 **Bus Routes**
- [ ] **Routes tab loads data** (not empty)
- [ ] **"All Routes" shows bus routes** (should have sample data)
- [ ] **"Nearby" routes work** (filters by location)
- [ ] **"Active" routes work** (may be empty but shouldn't crash)
- [ ] **Tapping a route shows details**
- [ ] **Route tracking works** (select route from map)

### 🔐 **Authentication**

## 🌐 **Network Requirements:**
- **Phone and computer on same WiFi**
- **Backend running** on your computer
- **API accessible** at `http://192.168.100.129:5000`

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist:**

### Map Still Blank?
1. Check Google Maps API key is working
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Try the location button (should center on your location)

### No Routes Loading?
1. Verify backend is running: `curl http://192.168.100.129:5000/api/routes`
2. Check phone can access backend from browser
3. Check app logs for network errors

### Location Not Working?
1. Grant location permissions in app settings
2. Check if GPS is enabled on phone
3. Try outdoors for better GPS signal

## 📊 **Expected Results:**
- **Map**: Should show your location with blue marker
- **Routes**: Should display ~5 sample routes with green/red markers
- **Backend**: Should respond with JSON data when tested
- **Location**: Should work outdoors with GPS enabled

## 🐛 **Known Limitations:**
- Google Maps API key may need real configuration for production
- Location services work best outdoors
- Some features require location permissions
- Backend must be running for routes to load
